  <p>Unit-1: Regression  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between two or more variables. It aims to find the best-fitting line or curve that describes the relationship between the independent variable(s) (X) and the dependent variable (Y). There are two types of regression: linear regression and nonlinear regression.    </li>
    <li>Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables, where the relationship can be represented by a straight line equation of the form Y = a + bX. Here, 'a' represents the intercept, and 'b' represents the slope of the line. The line of regression of Y on X is derived by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed Y values and the predicted Y values based on the line.    </li>
    <li>Similarly, the line of regression of X on Y can also be derived using the same principle. It represents the best-fitting line that predicts the independent variable (X) based on the dependent variable (Y).    </li>
    <li>Regression can be used for prediction by plugging in the values of the independent variable(s) into the regression equation to obtain the predicted value of the dependent variable.    </li>
    
  </ul>
  <p>Unit-2: Index Numbers  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Index numbers are statistical measures used to express changes in a variable relative to a base period. They are used to measure the changes in prices, quantities, or other economic variables over time. Index numbers help in comparing data at different points in time and studying the trends.    </li>
    <li>There are various methods for constructing index numbers, including simple index numbers and weighted index numbers. Simple index numbers give equal importance to all items being measured, while weighted index numbers assign different weights to different items based on their relative importance.    </li>
    <li>Some commonly used methods for constructing index numbers include the Laspeyres index, Paasche index, Marshall-Edgeworth index, etc. These methods differ in terms of the formulas used and the assumptions made.    </li>
    <li>Consistency tests are conducted to check the reliability and accuracy of index numbers. These tests include the time reversal test, factor reversal test, circular test, and base shifting. Splicing and deflating of index numbers are also done to adjust for changes in the base period or to remove the effect of inflation.

    </li>
    
  </ul>
  <p>Unit-3: Time Series  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Time series analysis involves studying data collected over different points in time to identify patterns, trends, and seasonal variations. It is commonly used in economics, finance, and other fields to analyze historical data and make forecasts.   </li>
   <li>The components of a time series include trend, seasonality, cyclical fluctuations, and irregular/random variations. Trend represents the long-term movement or direction of the data, while seasonality refers to regular patterns that repeat over shorter periods.   </li>
   <li>Methods used in time series analysis include simple averages, moving averages, and the least square method for trend estimation. Deseasonalization is a technique used to remove the seasonal component from the data, allowing for a clearer understanding of the underlying trend.   </li>
   <li>Time series analysis has various applications, such as forecasting future values, identifying patterns for decision-making, and understanding the limitations and risks associated with historical data.   </li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>Unit-4: Probability  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility, and 1 indicates certainty. Probability theory is used to analyze uncertainty and randomness in various fields, including mathematics, statistics, and everyday life.   </li>
   <li>Key concepts in probability include experiments (actions or processes with uncertain outcomes), events (outcomes of an experiment), mutually exclusive events (events that cannot occur simultaneously), collectively exclusive events (events that occur together but not separately), independent events (events that do not affect each other's probabilities), and simple events (basic outcomes of an experiment).   </li>
   <li>Probability can be approached using different methods: classical, empirical, subjective, and axiomatic. The classical approach relies on counting favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes in a sample space. The empirical approach uses observed frequencies of events to estimate probabilities. The subjective approach assigns probabilities based on personal judgments or beliefs. The axiomatic approach uses a set of axioms and theorems to define and calculate probabilities systematically.   </li>
   <li>Important theorems in probability include the addition theorem and the multiplication theorem. The addition theorem calculates the probability of the union of two or more events, while the multiplication theorem calculates the probability of the intersection of two or more independent events. Bayes' theorem is a fundamental theorem used to update probabilities based on new information.   </li>
   
  </ul>
  <p>Unit-5: Theoretical Distributions  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Theoretical distributions are mathematical models used to describe the probability distribution of random variables. They provide a framework for analyzing and understanding the behavior of data in various fields.   </li>
   <li>Binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial has two possible outcomes (success or failure). It is important in situations where events occur with a fixed probability and are independent of each other.   </li>
   <li>Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space when the events occur randomly and independently. It is often used to describe rare events with low probabilities.   </li>
   <li>Normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a continuous probability distribution that is widely used due to the central limit theorem. It is characterized by its mean and standard deviation and is used to model many natural phenomena and measurement errors.   </li>
   <li>Fitting a distribution involves estimating the parameters of the distribution based on the observed data. This estimation helps in understanding the underlying probability distribution and making predictions or inferences based on the data. The areas method is one approach used to fit a normal distribution.   </li>
   <li>These theoretical distributions play a crucial role in statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and modeling real-world phenomena.
   </li>
