  <p>Unit-1: Introduction to Income Tax      </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ypes of Taxes: There are various types of taxes, including income tax, goods and services tax (GST), property tax, excise tax, sales tax, etc. Each type of tax serves a specific purpose and is levied on different sources of income or transactions.</li>
    <li>History and Features of Income Tax Department in India: The Income Tax Department in India is responsible for administering and enforcing income tax laws. It was established in 1922 and has evolved over the years. The department ensures the collection of income tax from individuals, businesses, and other entities in accordance with the Income Tax Act.</li>
    <li>Assessee: An assessee refers to an individual or entity that is liable to pay income tax. It includes individuals, companies, firms, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), etc. The term "assessee" is used to identify the person or entity subject to tax assessment.</li>
    <li>Assessment Year and Previous Year: Assessment year refers to the financial year in which income is assessed and tax is calculated. It is the year following the previous year, during which income is earned. The previous year is the financial year in which income is earned and is assessed in the subsequent assessment year</li>
    <li>Agriculture Income: Agriculture income refers to income generated from agricultural activities such as farming, cultivation of crops, livestock rearing, etc. In India, agriculture income is generally exempt from income tax. However, certain exceptions exist, such as income derived from commercial agricultural activities.</li>
    <li>Types of Income: Income can be categorized into different types, including income from salaries, income from house property, profit and gains of business or profession, capital gains, and income from other sources. Each type of income is treated differently under the Income Tax Act.</li>
    <li>Exempted Income from Tax: Certain types of income are exempted from income tax. This includes income from agricultural activities, dividends from certain investments, interest on specified savings schemes, etc. These exemptions are provided by the government to promote specific sectors or activities.</li>
    <li>Residential Status: An individual's residential status determines the taxability of their income. In India, residential status is categorized as resident, non-resident, or not ordinarily resident. The tax liability and applicable tax rates vary based on the individual's residential status.</li>
    
  </ul>
  <p>Unit-2: Income from Salaries  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Salary and Income under Section Allowances Perquisites: Income from salaries includes the salary or wages received by an individual for employment services rendered.

    </li>
    <li>Deduction under Section 16 from Salary: Section 16 of the Income Tax Act provides deductions that can be claimed from salary income.

It includes deductions for municipal taxes paid, standard deduction (30% of the annual value), and interest on home loans. These deductions help reduce the taxable income from house property.   </li>
   
  </ul>
  <p>Unit-4: Profit and Gains of Business/Profession  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>Procedure for Income from Business: Income from business or profession is computed based on the profit or loss generated from business activities. The procedure involves determining the gross receipts, deducting allowable expenses, and arriving at the net profit or loss.   </li>
   <li>Allowable Expenses and Unallowed Expenses: Allowable expenses are expenses incurred in the normal course of business that are deductible from business income. They include rent, salaries, office expenses, depreciation, etc. Unallowed expenses are those that are not eligible for deduction as per the Income Tax Act.   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Unit-5: Capital Gains and Income from Other Sources  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Short-term and Long-term Capital Assets: Capital gains arise when there is a transfer of capital assets, such as property, shares, or securities. They can be categorized as short-term capital gains (assets held for a short period) or long-term capital gains (assets held for a long period). The tax treatment and rates differ for short-term and long-term capital gains.    </li>
    <li>Determination of Cost of Acquisition: The cost of acquisition is the cost at which an asset is acquired by the taxpayer. It includes the purchase price, incidental expenses, and improvement costs. The cost of acquisition is used to calculate capital gains when the asset is sold or transferred.
