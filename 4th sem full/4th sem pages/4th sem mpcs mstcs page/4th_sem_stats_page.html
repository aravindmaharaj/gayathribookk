  <p style="font-size: 25PX; text-align: center;">4TH SEMISTER STATISTICS</p>
</div>
  <li>1st Lesson: Testing of Statistical Hypothesis</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or draw
      conclusions about a population based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses:
      the null hypothesis (H₀) and the alternative hypothesis (H₁). The null hypothesis assumes no effect or
      no difference, while the alternative hypothesis suggests the presence of an effect or difference.</li>
    <li>Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis (H₀) represents the assumption of no effect or no difference in the
      population. It is often denoted as "no effect," "no change," or "no relationship."</li>
    <li>Alternative Hypothesis: The alternative hypothesis (H₁) contradicts the null hypothesis and suggests the
      presence of an effect, change, or relationship in the population. It can be one-sided (indicating a
      specific direction) or two-sided (allowing for any difference).</li>
    <li>Type I and Type II Errors: In hypothesis testing, there is always a chance of making errors. A Type I
      error occurs when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected (false positive), while a Type II error
      happens when the null hypothesis is incorrectly not rejected (false negative).</li>
    <li>Test Statistic and P-value: The test statistic is a numerical value calculated from the sample data that
      measures the discrepancy between the observed data and what is expected under the null hypothesis. The
      p-value represents the probability of obtaining results as extreme or more extreme than the observed
      data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It helps determine the strength of evidence against the null
      hypothesis.</li>
    <li>Critical Regions and Rejection Regions: To make a decision about the null hypothesis, critical regions
      or rejection regions are defined based on the chosen significance level (alpha). If the test statistic
      falls within the critical region, the null hypothesis is rejected; otherwise, it is not rejected.</li>
    <li>Steps in Hypothesis Testing: The general steps in hypothesis testing involve formulating the null and
      alternative hypotheses, selecting an appropriate test, collecting sample data, calculating the test
      statistic, determining the p-value or critical region, and making a decision based on the evidence.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>2nd Lesson: Statistical Hypothesis Large Sample Test</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Large Sample Test: A large sample test is used when the sample size is sufficiently large (typically greater
      than 30) to rely on the Central Limit Theorem. It assumes that the distribution of the sample means or proportions
      approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying population distribution.</li>
    <li>Z-test: The Z-test is a statistical test used in large sample testing. It converts the sample statistic (such as
      the sample mean or sample proportion) into a Z-score by subtracting the population mean and dividing by the
      population standard deviation (or using estimated values). The Z-score represents the number of standard
      deviations the sample statistic deviates from the population parameter under the null hypothesis.</li>
    <li>Confidence Intervals: In large sample tests, confidence intervals are often constructed to estimate the range of
      plausible values for the population parameter. These intervals provide a measure of uncertainty and are calculated
      based on the sample mean, standard deviation, and the chosen confidence level.</li>

  </ul>
  <li>3rd Lesson: Statistical Hypothesis Small Sample Test</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Small Sample Test: A small sample test is used when the sample size is relatively small (typically less than
      30). Unlike large sample tests, it does not rely on the Central Limit Theorem and takes into account the
      additional uncertainty introduced by small sample sizes.</li>
    <li>t-test: The t-test is a statistical test used in small sample testing. It calculates the t-statistic by
      comparing the difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean to the standard error of the
      mean. The t-distribution is used to obtain critical values or p-values for making decisions about the null
      hypothesis.</li>
    <li>Assumptions and Conditions: Small sample tests have assumptions and conditions that need to be met, such as the
      random sampling of data, independence of observations, and approximately normal distribution of the data. If these
      assumptions are violated, alternative nonparametric tests may be considered.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>4th Lesson: Nonparametric Test</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Nonparametric Test: Nonparametric tests are statistical tests that do not make explicit assumptions about the
      underlying population distribution or parameters. They are useful when the data do not meet the assumptions of
      parametric tests, which typically assume normality or specific distribution shapes.</li>
    <li>Chi-square Test for Independence: The chi-square test for independence is used to determine if there is a
      relationship between two categorical variables. It compares the observed frequencies to the expected frequencies
      under the assumption of independence.</li>
    <li>Mann-Whitney U Test (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test): The Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test)
      is a nonparametric test used to compare two independent groups or samples. It assesses whether the distributions
      of the two groups differ significantly.</li>
    <li>Kruskal-Wallis Test: The Kruskal-Wallis test is a nonparametric test used to compare more than two independent
      groups or samples. It extends the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to multiple groups and determines if there are
      significant differences in the medians.</li>
    <li>Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a nonparametric measure of
      the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two variables. It is based on the ranks of the
      data rather than the actual values.</li>
