  <P> <b> Groups:</b></P>
  <ul>
    <li>A group is a fundamental concept in algebra. It consists of a set of elements and an operation that combines any
      two elements to produce a third element. The operation can be addition, denoted as "+", or multiplication, denoted
      as "⋅" or "*", depending on the context. The set, often denoted as G, together with the operation, forms a group
      (G, ∗) or (G, +).</li>
    <li>Elementary properties of groups: A group is a set G equipped with an operation (usually denoted as * or +) that
      satisfies closure, associativity, identity, and inverse properties. Closure means that for any two elements a and
      b in G, the result of the operation (a * b or a + b) is also in G. Associativity states that for any three
      elements a, b, and c in G, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c) or (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). The identity element e
      satisfies a * e = e * a = a or a + e = e + a = a for any element a in G. Finally, each element a in G has an
      inverse a^(-1) such that a * a^(-1) = a^(-1) * a = e or a + (-a) = (-a) + a = e.</li>
    <li>Finite groups: A finite group is a group with a finite number of elements. The number of elements in a finite
      group is called its order.</li>
    <li>Subgroups: A subgroup H of a group G is a subset of G that forms a group under the same operation. In other
      words, H is closed under the operation, contains the identity element, and every element in H has an inverse in H.
    </li>
    <li>Subgroup test: To check if a subset H of a group G is a subgroup, we need to verify closure (if a * b is in H
      for any a, b in H), identity (the identity element of G is in H), and inverse (if the inverse of each element in H
      is also in H).</li>
    <li>Cyclic subgroups and their properties: A cyclic subgroup of a group G is generated by a single element, denoted
      as <a>. It consists of all the powers of a and their inverses. Cyclic subgroups have properties such as being
        closed under the group operation, containing the identity element, and being either finite or infinite in size.
    </li>

  </ul>
  <p>2nd Lesson: Permutation Groups </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Properties of permutations: Permutations are bijective mappings of a set onto itself. They can be represented in
      cycle notation, where each cycle represents the rearrangement of elements. Permutations can be composed, inverted,
      and exhibit properties like associativity.</li>
    <li>Isomorphism: Isomorphism is a concept in group theory that refers to a bijective mapping between two groups,
      preserving the group structure. If two groups are isomorphic, they share the same algebraic properties.</li>
    <li>Properties of cosets and applications of cosets: Cosets partition a group G into subsets of the form gH, where g
      is an element of G and H is a subgroup of G. Cosets have applications in group theory, such as Lagrange's theorem,
      which states that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group.</li>
    <li>Permutation groups: Permutation groups are groups formed by permutations. They are used to study symmetry and
      combinatorial structures, and they exhibit properties such as closure, associativity, and the existence of an
      identity and inverse elements.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>3rd Lesson: Rings</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Groups homeomorphism: A group homomorphism is a map between two groups that preserves the group structure. It
      satisfies f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b) for any elements a and b in the domain group.</li>
    <li>Properties of homeomorphism: Homeomorphisms between groups have properties like preserving the identity element
      and inverses, as well as preserving the group operation.</li>
    <li>Introduction to rings: A ring is an algebraic structure that consists of a set equipped with two operations,
      usually addition and multiplication. Rings generalize the properties of integers. Rings may or may not have a
      multiplicative identity element, and their multiplication operation need not be commutative.</li>
    <li>Properties of rings and subrings: Rings have properties such as closure, associativity, commutativity (for some
      rings), distributivity, and the existence of an additive identity. A subring is a subset of a ring that forms a
      ring under the same operations.</li>
    <li>Integral domains: Integral domains are rings in which multiplication is commutative, and they do not have zero
      divisors (i.e., a * b = 0 implies a = 0 or b = 0).</li>

  </ul>
  <p>4th Lesson: Ideals</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prime ideals and maximal ideals: In a ring, an ideal is a special subset that is closed under addition and
      absorbs elements from the ring. Prime ideals are ideals that have additional properties, such as being prime
      numbers in certain rings. Maximal ideals are ideals that are not strictly contained within any other ideals of the
      ring.</li>
    <li>Ring homeomorphism: A ring homeomorphism is a bijective map between two rings that preserves the ring structure.
      It satisfies f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) and f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b) for any elements a and b in the domain ring.</li>
    <li>Ideals play a crucial role in ring theory. They allow us to study the structure and properties of rings by
      focusing on subsets that exhibit special properties, such as being closed under multiplication by elements from
      the ring. Ideals are used to define quotient rings, which are rings formed by partitioning a given ring by an
      ideal. They provide a framework for studying factorization, divisibility, and congruence in algebraic structures.
    </li>
    <li>In the context of rings, an ideal is a special subset of the ring that possesses certain properties. Let (R, +,
      ⋅) be a ring, and let I be a subset of R. I is said to be an ideal if: <br>
      a) I is a subgroup of (R, +), meaning that I is closed under addition and contains the additive inverse of any
      element it contains. <br>

      b) I absorbs elements from R, meaning that for any element a in R and any element b in I, both a ⋅ b and b ⋅ a are
      in I.
